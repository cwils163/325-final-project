i cannot take this anymore. its fucking pathetic. I am not wanted here and I am getting out one way or another. I am done. if i have not moved out by this time next year, I am killing myself.
I am under so much pressure to pass. If I do not pass my exam tomorrow I risk losing my scholarship and I will have to drop out. It is almost impossible for me to find a good job in my country without a degree so I will just end up homeless and die within a year anyways. I do not want that but all of this pressure is driving me crazy! I have not taken a break in three years. I am drained and I have been contemplating suicide a lot lately. It just feels like there is no place for me on earth anymore. University is making me want to kill myself.
