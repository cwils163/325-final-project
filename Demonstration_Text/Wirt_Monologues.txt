No, though I am lost, my wounded heart resides back home, in pieces, strewn about the graveyard of my lost love.
I dunno, sometimes I feel like I'm just like a boat upon a winding river, twisting, towards an endless black sea, further, and further, drifting away from where I want to be, who I want to be.
Yeah, I guess, but so what, We're still not any closer to getting home. I just don't know what I'm doing out here anymore. I don't know if we'll ever get back home.
The Beast, It must be the Beast out there, The obsidian cricket of our inevitable twighlight singing our requiem.
Can we please stop pretending we're gonna get home? Can we admit we're lost for good? That this fog is deeper than we can ever understand? That we are but wayward leaves, scattered to the air by an indifferent wind? Can we just admit we're never gonna get back home Greg, can we do that?
No, I just want to wallow in misery. Sara and Jason Funderberker, ugh, that guy's got his act together. He's the total package, I can't compete.
That's it, That's the end, Once again you ruin my life.
