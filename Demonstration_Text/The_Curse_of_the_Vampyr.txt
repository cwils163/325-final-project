Harken close and beware the Vampyr.
Beware its cold beauty. Beware its charm. Beware its curse.
Above all, beware the pale noble, for the Vampyr cannot bear to be of the common folk.
How doth one protect from the beast?
Walk not in the blackest night, for the Vampyr loves these nights more than any other. If you must walk, do so by the light of our moon and take care. Carry the blessings and marks of your God at all times.
But remember, your home is your fortress, if protected well. If you hear a knock in the night, be wary. Let no stranger into your home.
If it be a friend, look upon them. Do you find them pallid and wan? 
See you any mark upon their neck? See you any dirt upon their clothes?
Unless their need is great, turn all away but the most trusted.
And if the Beast finds a way into your home, flee. Leave love and family behind.
You will not save them if you fight. You will not see them again.
But they will see you, pale and smiling, calling them into the night.
